  hello, my name is thu. i like cream cheese.
  i go to milpitas high school. i will be a junior next year. i play the trumpet in the school band.
  i don't like bell peppers. i like science, but not the science at my school.
  a fun fact about me is that i have been doing high jump in track for two years, but i suck so i'm gonna quit.
